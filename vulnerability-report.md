# Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Author:** Harsh Vardhan Singh 

**Environment:** Virtual lab with 4 hosts (3 Windows VMs, 1 hardened Linux VM)  
**Tools Used:** Nmap 7.93

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a network vulnerability assessment performed on four virtual machines in a controlled lab environment. Using Nmap, open ports and running services were identified and analyzed to evaluate security posture. Key vulnerabilities related primarily to exposed Windows SMB and RPC services were detected. One Linux host showed strong hardening with no open ports.

---

## 2. Scope and Methodology

- **Scope:**  
  Four virtual machines comprising three Windows Hosts and one Linux Host.

- **Methodology:**  
  TCP SYN and service version scans (`nmap -sS -sV`) were used to discover open ports and identify services. Additional scripts assessed SMB security features and system time. Outputs were sanitized to protect sensitive network information.

## 3. Detailed Findings

### Host 1 (Windows VM)

- **Open Ports:** 135 (RPC), 445 (SMB)
- **Services:** Microsoft Windows RPC, Microsoft Windows SMB
- **MAC Address:** XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (QEMU virtual NIC)
- **SMB Security:** Message signing enabled but not required
- **OS Guess:** QEMU user mode network gateway (98% confidence)
- **Traceroute:** 1 hop, 1.28 ms latency

**Assessment:**  
Open RPC and SMB ports pose risk for remote code execution and lateral movement attacks if exploited. The absence of mandatory SMB message signing allows possible man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Host 2 (Windows VM)

- **Open Ports:** 135 (RPC), 445 (SMB)
- **Services:** Microsoft Windows RPC, Microsoft Windows SMB
- **MAC Address:** XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (QEMU virtual NIC)
- **SMB Security:** Message signing enabled but not required
- **OS Guess:** QEMU user mode network gateway (96% confidence)
  
**Assessment:**  
Same vulnerabilities as Host 1, exposing the system to similar risks involving SMB-related exploits.

---

### Host 3 (Windows VM)

- **Open Ports:** 135 (RPC), 445 (SMB)
- **Services:** Microsoft Windows RPC, Microsoft Windows SMB
- **MAC Address:** XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (QEMU virtual NIC)
- **SMB Security:** Message signing enabled but not required
- **OS Guess:** QEMU user mode network gateway (94% confidence)
- **Traceroute:** 1 hop, 0.77 ms latency

**Assessment:**  
Mirrors risks of Hosts 1 and 2, representing a consistent attack surface across Windows VMs.

---

### Host 4 (Hardened Linux VM)

- **Open Ports:** None detected (all 1000 scanned ports closed)
- **Network Distance:** 0 hops (localhost or direct connection)
- **OS Details:** Fingerprints broad; no specific OS match due to lack of responses

**Assessment:**  
Effectively hardened with no services exposed externally; acts as a security model within this lab.

---

## 4. Risks Identified

- Open SMB and RPC ports are known vectors for major attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya.
- SMB message signing is enabled but not mandatory; this weakens protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Absence of port filtering or firewall rules allows exposure of critical services.
- Potential for ransomware propagation and lateral movement across the network due to these vulnerabilities.

---

## 5. Recommendations

- **Patch Management:** Regularly update all systems, especially Windows hosts, to apply security patches.
- **Enforce SMB Message Signing:** Configure SMB to require message signing to prevent traffic tampering.
- **Restrict Open Ports:** Configure firewalls to limit access to RPC and SMB ports only from trusted internal sources.
- **Disable Unused Services:** For example, HTTPAPI (port 5357) if not actively used.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate vulnerable systems within segmented subnets to limit attack propagation.
- **Monitor Network Traffic:** Use intrusion detection/prevention systems to detect suspicious SMB or RPC activity.
- **Follow Security Frameworks:** Apply CIS Controls, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and ISO 27001 guidelines for ongoing security management.
